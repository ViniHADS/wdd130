                Hello! My name is Vinicius Araujo, and I am from Rio Grande Do Sul, Brazil, I am enthusiastic about programming, love to watch 'animes from japan', love to watch 'C-Dramas from China' because side by side my studies in BYUI I'm studying Mandarim 
                because one of mine greatest dreams to I want to reach in this life is to meet the Great Wall in China, I love to play Basketball and my favorite team from NBA is New York Knicks but the player that I most like to watch play obviously is Lebron James,
                I like a lot to do cycling is mine favorite physical exercise I also do physical warm-ups but I don't like too much, I like to play games in the computer, the game I most play is 'Counter-Strike from Valve', I'm single and still looking for someone who 
                really love the Christ and his gospel, currently I'm 1 first counselor in the bishopric of mine ward that I attend, I live by myself, normally is the 'sons' that go out from the house of parents, but in my case was inverse, mine parents live because 
                the moved to another province in Brazil, they moved to live in 'Santa Catarina' to live more close from their grandchildrens, because the most part of them live there because my brothers live in that province, but all of us is naturally from 
                Rio Grande Do Sul, I've more 4 brothers and 1 sister, in total we're 6.

            <p>
                Here in my state, Rio Grande do Sul, most people drink Chimarr&atilde;o, which is a hot tea drink. Its name is Chimarr&atilde;o, not mate, because it does not derive from the mate tea that is usually drunk by everyone.
